The Dotter framework
====================

Dotter is an ORM like system that allows accessing structured data in a typesafe and storage independent way. Schema based and schema-less databases, as well as relational and non-relational databases are supported. All of the structure, types and queries are checked at compile time and optimized queries are automatically pre-computed. A primary goal is to avoid dynamic memory allocations as far as possible.

The current state is an early working preview with a lot of details of the design still missing. Especially cross-table relations and advanced queries need to be worked out.
